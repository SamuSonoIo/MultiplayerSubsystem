# Multiplayer System for UE5

## Introduction

Hello everyone!

Have you ever wondered how multiplayer works in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)? If so, this repository is for you!

I've uploaded the header (`.h`) and CPP (`.cpp`) files that contain the core logic for a basic multiplayer system. Whether you're new to UE5 or simply looking for a foundation to build your own multiplayer features, this should be a great starting point.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. I hope this helps you with your game development projects!

## Can i use it?

These are just some drafts i made, if you find an use case feel free to use them, but these are not Drag 'n drop as it's almost impossible to do with Unreal Engine5

*Note:* This use STEAM Multiplayer System.
